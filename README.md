# Exam project: 18. Two-dimensional integrator
Please note that the exam project is written using nested functions. Therefore, I cannot compile it properly on my Windows computer. 
However, it should work fine and after my intention on any Linux or Mac computer where the GCC compiler includes use of nested functions.
