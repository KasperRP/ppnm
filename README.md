# Exam project: 18. Two-dimensional integrator
Please note that the exam project is written using nested functions. Therefore, I cannot compile it properly on my Windows computer. 
However, it should work fine and after my intention on any system where the GCC compiler includes the use of nested functions. 
In addition to my implementation, I have included a small LaTeX file where I describe the ideas behind my implementation. All this is found 
in the folder "exam". In the folders "exercises" and "homework", my solutions of the exercises and homework of the course are found.
