Testing the quasi-random Monte Carlo routine on same functions as in A:

Integral of exp(x*y)*sin(pi*z) from [0,0,0] to [1,1,1] = 0.838987
Analytical result = 0.839003
Error = 2.69421e-05
Number of sampled points = 1000000

Integral of cos(x)^2*sin(y)^2 from [0,0] to [2pi, 2pi] = 9.87053
Analytical result = pi^2=9.869604401
Error = 0.00194102
Number of sampled points = 1000000
